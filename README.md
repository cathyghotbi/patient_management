The program starts by loading patient data from a JSON file, then repeatedly displays a menu.
Based on the user’s choice, it performs actions such as searching, filtering, grouping, or saving data.
The loop continues until the user selects Exit.

The project is organized into folders based on responsibility: 
models store data structures, 
services handle logic, 
UI handles input/output, 
and the main file controls the program flow.


example of how it works:

In order to run the test, Python needs to know where the project root is, so:
In PyCharm, right-click the patient_management folder
Click “Mark Directory as”
Click “Sources Root”
